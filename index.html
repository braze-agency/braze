	<h2>Let's make lots of money.</h2>
	<section class="box-row">
		<div class="box">
			<p>We love and baby the internet as much as the next agency, but we aren't here just to make things pretty or experiment on your time. We know that as much as we get geeky over what we create for you, it's main purpose is to make your business money (and with our expertise, create a great experience for your customers along the way).</p>
		</div>

	<h2>Who we are.</h2>
	<section class="box-row">
		<div class="box">
			<p>We love the internet and want it to be great for everyone. Our main focus is to create designs that are accessible to anyone, regardless of their internet speed, device, resolution, physical abilities, etc. We care about accessibility and the progressive web.</p>
			<p>We also don't take ourselves too serious. We will talk to you like a human being and not a computer. We want to make you feel comfortable and in the loop. You'll never hear us use buzzwords just to sound like we know what's going on.</p>

	<h2>What we do.</h2>
	<section class="box-row">
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-laptop-phone"></span>
			<h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
			<p>Deliver an experience that delights at every screen size. A responsive website will continue to adapt to new device sizes as they are released, eliminating the need to pay for a redesign just to conform to the screen resolutions, making responsive web design a great investment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-screen"></span>
			<h4>Web Design &amp; Development</h4>
			<p>While we advocate for responsive design, there are some scenarios where a standard website may be necessary. We are flexible in our abilities, so if you already have a site designed, but it needs to be coded, or you have the code, but not the aesthetics, we can work with you to get your project completed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-magnifier"></span>
			<h4>Search Engine Optimization</h4>
			<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) used to be a game that could be rigged, but search engines have changed their model and now SEO is all about great copy. Get ranked higher in search results by having original, relevant, and thoughtful copy on your website. We will work with you to develop original content for your site or we can spruce up copy that you already have.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-bold"></span>
			<h4>Branding</h4>
			<p>A strong identity is crucial for any company. Your companies’ branding may be the only thing a potential customer gets to see of your business, so that first impression should be a great one. Having a compelling brand identity attracts customers by showing them that your company is established and genuine.</p>

		<div class="box-sm">

			<h4>Graphic Design</h4>

		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-printer"></span>
			<h4>Print Design</h4>
			<p>Not only will we do the design for you, we do printing as well! From the collateral that goes with your branding to a one-off piece, and everything in-between, we will provide you with high-quality printed materials. Business cards and stationery, brochures, flyers, and posters are some of the things we can print.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-bullhorn"></span>
			<h4>Promotional Materials</h4>
			<p>Giving your customers promotional materials with your brand on it is a great way to keep your company at the forefront of their mind. Anything from a pen to a mug may start a conversation between one of your current customers and a potential one. Customers will also feel appreciated when they receive a nice item from you, creating brand loyalty.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-thumbs-up"></span>
			<h4>Social Media</h4>
			<p>74% of internet users are on social media.<sup><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> If your company isn’t on social media, you’re missing out on a chance to connect with current and potential customers. Social media is a great arena to show your customers who you are. It also gives you the opportunity to learn more about them and their desires.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-sm">
			<span class="lnr lnr-highlight"></span>
			<h4>Copywriting / Copyediting / Proofreading</h4>
			<p>Communicating clearly with your customers is very important. Preventing spelling errors, misuses of words, and wrong or confusing information are just a few of the things that having proofed copy can do. Having solid, concise copy allows your customers to feel secure in their affairs with your company.</p>
