				<h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>

				<h4>Web Design &amp; Development</h4>
				<p>While we advocate for responsive design, there are some scenarios where a standard website may be necessary. We are flexible in our abilities, so if you already have a site designed, but it needs to be coded, or you have the code, but not the aesthetics, we can work with you to get your project completed.</p>

Get ranked higher in search results by having original, relevant, and thoughtful copy on your website. We will work with you to develop original content for your site or we can spruce up copy that you already have.</p>
